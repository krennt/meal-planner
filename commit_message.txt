Fix TypeScript build errors and update deployment documentation

# Problem
- Production build was failing due to TypeScript errors not caught in development
- TypeScript configuration was missing explicit type enforcement
- README lacked guidance on handling TypeScript in the project

# Changes
- Fixed React component return types across all page components
- Added explicit type annotations to all callback parameters:
  - map(), filter(), forEach(), findIndex() callback parameters
  - Object method callbacks (Object.keys().forEach())
- Added noImplicitAny: true to tsconfig.json
- Updated storageService.ts to use proper types instead of any[]
- Enhanced README with:
  - TypeScript configuration guidelines
  - Build troubleshooting section
  - Detailed deployment instructions

# Result
- Application now builds successfully in production mode
- Deployment to Firebase Hosting works as expected
- Better documentation for future contributors
